### Salisbury University Student | Computer Science and Computational Mathematical Sciences Major | Data Science Minor

I enjoy computation, video games (both playing and researching game design), golf, card games, and television.
These repositories are all major coding and work that I have done for my college classes. I try to update frequently.
