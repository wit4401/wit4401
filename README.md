<div align="center">I enjoy computation, video games (both playing and researching game design), golf, card games, and television. These repositories are all major coding and work that I have done for my college classes or on my own. I update frequently.</div>

<h2 align="center">Current Courses</h2>

* COSC 420: Hi-Performance Computing
  * Principles and practice of parallel and distributed computing. Topics include modern computing architectures, concurrency principles and algorithm design, and applications and programming. 
* COSC 425: Software Engineering
  * Study of conventional and object oriented software engineering principles and methods: the human computer interface, requirements analysis, prototyping, software design, system models, use of tools, project management, implementation, testing strategies, software metrics, maintenance, quality assurance, ethics and professional responsibility.
